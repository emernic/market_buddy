This is a speedy command line interface for warframe.market. It is intended for easily alt-tabing out of the game to place an order or check a price. Further instructions can be seen when running the program.

Simply run market_buddy.py in the command line using python 3.x :) email nickemery23@gmail.com for questions or comments.
